# Comprehensive Specification for Web App for Python Code Execution

## 1. Implementation Requirements

### 1.1 Detailed Functional Requirements
- **Code Input**: Users must be able to paste or type Python code within a shell-like input area.
- **Syntax Checking**: The application must automatically check for syntax errors in real-time as users type:
  - **Highlighting**: Errors should be visually highlighted.
  - **Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback on the type and location of errors.
- **Execution**: Users must be able to execute the code by clicking a "Run" button:
  - **Output Display**: Show the output of the executed code immediately below the input area.
- **Error Display**: If there are syntax or runtime errors:
  - **Messages**: Users should receive clear and descriptive error messages indicating the nature of the error.

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: 
  - Code execution response time should be less than 2 seconds for standard scripts.
  - The application should handle at least 100 concurrent users without degradation of performance.
- **Security**: 
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent code injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: 
  - The architecture must support horizontal scaling to accommodate increased user traffic.
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.

### 1.3 Acceptance Criteria
- All functional requirements must be met as specified.
- Performance targets are achieved under load testing conditions.
- Security measures are validated through vulnerability testing.
- Compliance with accessibility standards is verified.

## 2. Technical Specifications

### 2.1 File Structure and Modules
- **[CREATE NEW]** `app.py` - Main application file containing the Flask application.
- **[CREATE NEW]** `templates/index.html` - Front-end template for user interaction.
- **[CREATE NEW]** `static/styles.css` - CSS for styling the application.
- **[CREATE NEW]** `static/script.js` - JavaScript for client-side interaction.
- **[MODIFY EXISTING]** `requirements.txt` - Ensure that all required libraries are listed.

### 2.2 Class/Function Signatures and Interfaces
- **Function**: `def execute_code(code: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:`
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `code`: The Python code to execute.
  - **Returns**: 
    - A tuple containing:
      - `output`: The output of the code execution.
      - `error_message`: Any error message generated during execution.

### 2.3 Data Models and Schemas
- **UserSession Model**:
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key
  - `code`: Text, Not Null
  - `output`: Text, Nullable
  - `error_message`: Text, Nullable

### 2.4 API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `/execute`
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Request Format**:
    ```json
    {
      "code": "print('Hello, World!')"
    }
    ```
  - **Response Format**:
    ```json
    {
      "output": "Hello, World!",
      "error_message": null
    }
    ```
  - **Status Codes**:
    - `200`: Success
    - `400`: Bad Request (for syntax errors)
    - `500`: Internal Server Error

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Numbered Actionable Steps
1. **Set up the Flask application** in `app.py`.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Application starts without errors and displays a welcome message.
2. **Create the front-end template** `index.html`.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The page loads correctly with an input area, a "Run" button, and an output display area.
3. **Implement the `/execute` endpoint** to handle code execution.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Returns output or error message correctly based on input.
4. **Add client-side JavaScript** in `script.js` to capture input and display results dynamically.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Output is displayed without page reload.
5. **Unit tests for the API** and integration tests for front-end interaction.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Achieve a minimum of 80% test coverage.

### 3.2 Dependencies Between Steps
- Step 2 must be completed before Step 4 can be effectively implemented.
- Step 3 must be completed before testing can occur in Step 5.

### 3.3 Testing Requirements for Each Step
- Step 1: Test to ensure the app starts without errors.
- Step 2: Test to verify that the HTML loads correctly.
- Step 3: Test the `/execute` endpoint with valid and invalid inputs.
- Step 4: Test that JavaScript functions correctly in updating the DOM with output.
- Step 5: Ensure that all unit and integration tests are passing.

## 4. Code Guidelines

### 4.1 Specific Code Patterns to Follow
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Document functions with docstrings.

### 4.2 Libraries/Frameworks to Use
- Utilize `Flask` for web framework capabilities.
- Use `Pygments` for syntax highlighting.
- Implement `Flask-Cors` for handling CORS issues.

### 4.3 Security Considerations
- Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- Avoid executing code directly; implement a sandboxed execution environment.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration settings.

### 4.4 Error Handling Requirements
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios.
- Log errors for server-side debugging while providing user-friendly messages.

## 5. Definition of Done

### 5.1 Specific Completion Criteria
- All features are implemented as per the requirements.
- Code is reviewed and adheres to coding standards.
- All tests pass successfully with at least 80% coverage.

### 5.2 Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum of 80% code coverage across unit and integration tests.
- Documented test cases for all major functionalities.

### 5.3 Documentation Requirements
- Update `README.md` with instructions on how to run the application.
- Document the API endpoints and expected request/response formats.

## Critical Guidelines for Coding Agents

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE Writing Any Code

1. **Search Existing Codebase**
   - Check the project repository for similar functionality
   - Use grep/search to find existing utilities and helpers
   - DO NOT duplicate code that already exists

2. **Check Existing Libraries**
   - Review `requirements.txt` for available libraries
   - DO NOT install libraries that are already available
   - Justify any new library additions

### üéØ Code Quality Standards

**Python Style (PEP 8)**:
- 100 character line limit
- snake_case for functions/variables
- PascalCase for classes
- Type hints for ALL parameters and returns
- Google-style docstrings for all functions/classes
- Meaningful variable names (no single letters except loop counters)

**API Design (RESTful)**:
- Resource-based URLs (nouns, not verbs): `/api/users` not `/api/getUsers`
- Standard HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
- Standard status codes: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)
- Consistent error format: `{"error": {"code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Description"}}`
- JSON responses for all endpoints

**Testing Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- AAA pattern: Arrange (setup), Act (execute), Assert (verify)
- Test file naming: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test function naming: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_result>()`
- Test happy path, error cases, edge cases, and boundary conditions

**Security Requirements**:
- Validate ALL user input (type, format, range, length)
- Use parameterized queries for database operations (NEVER string concatenation)
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Store secrets in environment variables (NEVER hardcode)
- Use HTTPS for external communications
- Implement rate limiting for public APIs
- Log security events (failed auth, suspicious activity)

**Error Handling**:
- Use specific exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, etc.) not bare `except:`
- Log errors with context using the logging module
- Return user-friendly error messages (don't leak internal details)
- Handle errors at appropriate levels (don't let them bubble to root)

**Documentation**:
- Module-level docstring explaining purpose
- Class docstrings with attributes and examples
- Function docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Inline comments for complex logic (explain WHY, not WHAT)
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md
