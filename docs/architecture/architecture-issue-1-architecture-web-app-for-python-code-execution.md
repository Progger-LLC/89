## Original Requirements

Design architecture for a web application that allows users to paste or type Python code in a shell-like window, automatically check for syntax errors, highlight errors, and include a "run" button to execute the code and display its output.

# Comprehensive Specification Sheet for Web App for Python Code Execution

## 1. Overview
- **Purpose Statement**: Develop a web application that enables users to input Python code, validate its syntax, execute it, and display the output seamlessly.
- **Priority Level**: Critical
- **Estimated Complexity**: Moderate

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Code Input**: Users must be able to paste or type Python code in a shell-like window.
- [ ] **Syntax Checking**: The application must automatically check for syntax errors in the code.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Errors are highlighted in real-time as the user types.
- [ ] **Execution**: Users must have a "Run" button to execute the code.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Output of the code is displayed immediately after execution.
- [ ] **Error Display**: If there are syntax errors, users should see a clear message indicating the type and location of the error.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance Targets**: 
  - Response time for code execution should be under 2 seconds for standard scripts.
  - Support at least 100 concurrent users.
- **Security Requirements**: 
  - All user inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent code injection attacks.
- **Scalability Requirements**: 
  - The architecture should allow for horizontal scaling to accommodate increased traffic.
- **Accessibility Requirements**: 
  - The application must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Architecture Decision
- **Architecture Pattern**: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Rationale**: This approach separates concerns, making it easier to manage user input, logic, and presentation layers. It also allows for easier testing and maintenance.

### 3.2 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9
- **Framework**: Flask 2.0
- **Database**: SQLite 3 (for storing user sessions and execution logs)
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `Flask-Cors` for handling CORS
  - `Pygments` for syntax highlighting
  - `Jinja2` for template rendering

### 3.3 Data Models
- **UserSession**
  - `id`: Integer, Primary Key
  - `code`: Text, Not Null
  - `output`: Text
  - `error_message`: Text
  - **Relationships**: One-to-many with execution logs.

### 3.4 API Contracts
- **Endpoint URLs**: `/execute`
- **HTTP Methods**: POST
- **Request Format**: 
  ```json
  {
    "code": "print('Hello, World!')"
  }
  ```
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "output": "Hello, World!",
    "error_message": null
  }
  ```
- **Status Codes**:
  - 200: Success
  - 400: Bad Request (syntax error)
  - 500: Internal Server Error
- **Authentication Requirements**: None for this feature.

### 3.5 File Structure
- [CREATE NEW] `app.py` - main application file
- [CREATE NEW] `templates/index.html` - front-end template
- [CREATE NEW] `static/styles.css` - styles for the application
- [CREATE NEW] `static/script.js` - client-side JavaScript for handling user interaction
- [MODIFY EXISTING] `requirements.txt` - add new libraries

## 4. Implementation Checklist

### 4.1 Pre-Implementation Research
- [ ] Search existing codebase for similar functionality in `src/`.
- [ ] Check `requirements.txt` for existing libraries.
- [ ] Review coding standards as per the team guidelines.
- [ ] Identify existing utilities/helpers to reuse.

### 4.2 Reuse Assessment
**Existing Code to Reuse**: None identified at this time.

**Existing Libraries**:
- DO NOT install `Flask`, `Flask-Cors`, and `Pygments`, already available in `requirements.txt`.

**New Code Required**:
- Implement the execution environment for running Python code securely. Existing code cannot fulfill this requirement due to the need for a sandboxed environment.

### 4.3 Implementation Steps
1. Set up Flask application structure in `app.py`.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Application runs without errors.
2. Create the front-end template `index.html` for user input.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Page loads correctly with input field and run button.
3. Implement the `/execute` endpoint to handle code execution.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Returns output or error message correctly.
4. Add client-side JavaScript to handle form submission and display results.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Output displayed on the same page without reload.
5. Write unit tests for the API and integration tests for the front-end interaction.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Minimum 80% test coverage achieved.

## 5. Standards Compliance

### 5.1 Code Standards (Python/PEP 8)
- Follow all specified code standards including naming conventions and documentation.

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% test coverage.
- Unit tests for all functions in `app.py`.
- Integration tests for the `/execute` endpoint.
- Test file naming: `test_app.py`.
- Use AAA pattern for tests.

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use parameterized queries where applicable.
- Do not hardcode secrets; use environment variables instead.
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS.

## 6. Dependencies & Integration

### 6.1 Internal Dependencies
- This module will depend on existing user authentication services if implemented.

### 6.2 External Dependencies
- No required external APIs.
- New packages to add to `requirements.txt`: None.

### 6.3 Database Changes
- No significant database changes required; SQLite will be used for session management.

## 7. Error Handling
- Expected error scenarios include syntax errors, execution errors, and server errors.
- Use `ValueError` for syntax errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Error response formats should mirror the response format above.

## 8. Security Considerations
- No authentication is required for this feature.
- Input validation rules must be strict to avoid code injection.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## 9. Performance Requirements
- The application should respond to code execution requests within 2 seconds.
- Optimize queries to the SQLite database.
- Consider caching frequent execution results if applicable.

## 10. Testing Scenarios
- **Happy Path Test Cases**: Input valid Python code and check for correct output.
- **Error Scenario Test Cases**: Input invalid code and check for correct error messages.
- **Edge Case Test Cases**: Input large scripts and check for performance.
- **Expected Test Results**: All tests should pass with expected outputs.

## 11. Acceptance Criteria
- Code input functionality works as intended.
- Syntax checking highlights errors in real-time.
- Code execution returns expected output or error messages.
- All implemented features must be covered by tests with a minimum of 80% coverage.
